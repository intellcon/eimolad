Do not forget to add the diffusion profiles from package to the Diffusion Profile List in HDRP!!!

If you do not do it, you will experimenting a "black screen" or the vegetation will not render property 

The easiest way to do this is selecting any Vegetation material, and in the material properties (down in the diffusion profile box) there must be a FIX button.

This Step is about the HDRP workflow! Find more information in the Unity Docs: 
https://docs.unity.cn/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@9.0/manual/Diffusion-Profile.html

Find an unity package to convert shaders from HDRP to URP: Seedmesh>Shader_graph>Shaders
